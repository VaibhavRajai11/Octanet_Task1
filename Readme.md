# Landing Page

This is a simple landing page project designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The page features a navigation bar, a slideshow for showcasing images, and sections to display various products.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The page layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Slideshow**: A dynamic slideshow that automatically transitions between images.
- **Product Cards**: Display various products (Mobiles, Watches, Mouse) in a grid layout.
- **Search Bar**: A search input field to simulate searching functionality.
- **Font Awesome Icons**: Integration with Font Awesome for icons.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the landing page.
- `style.css`: Inline CSS is used to style the page components (Consider external stylesheet for better separation of concerns).
- `script.js`: Inline JavaScript is used for the slideshow functionality (Consider external JavaScript file for better organization).

## Dependencies

- **Font Awesome**: Used for the shopping cart icon in the navigation bar.
- **Google Fonts**: 'Roboto' font is used throughout the page for a clean and modern look.

2. **Open `index.html` in your browser**:
    - Simply open the `index.html` file in any web browser to view the landing page.

## Slideshow Images

- The slideshow images are specified in the JavaScript section of the `index.html` file.
- Ensure that the images (`img1.jpg`, `img2.jpg`, `img3.jpg`) are available in the project directory.

## Customization

- **Slideshow**: Update the image paths in the `window.onload` function to change the images in the slideshow.

## Future Improvements
